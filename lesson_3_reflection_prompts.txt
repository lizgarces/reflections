When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If I need to share my files, its important to work with the correct version.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   Because I need to commit when something is completely done. The only way to be sure is if I do the commit.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is a copy in your local server. So you use Clone  to put stuff in your server.
    Branches is a security copy of master in the repository. Branches in your local git y en GitHub.
    Fork is a copy the master in GitHub You can use fork in GitHub

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To have the last know information available and solve conflicts.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Human relations are complicated. And trying to coordinate between several persons will be messy.
    With GitHub everybody will have a picture and information about the update. No surprises.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    I will make changes in a separate branch if we are working in a team in the same project with several members.
    And I will make changes in master Only if I am working alone in the project. If  the rest of the team just need to read about it not so frecuently.
    Benefits of changing a branch: the source code is safe and everyone can work in different parts of the project.
    Benefits of changing in master: it is fast.
